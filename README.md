# Generative Hub App: Powered by Forma NFTs

A decentralized platform for managing and securing NFT using blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs.

## 🌟 Overview

Leveraging onchain data:
Generative art will use different types of onchain data such as:

Transaction hashes.
Wallet addresses.
These data will influence the resulting image generated by the algorithm.
Specific technology:
Forma provides the ability to compile custom metadata, to be stored on-chain. Create new inputs for generative algorithms.

For example, NFTs with specific attributes may have a higher probability of generating rare works from a collection.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of two components:

### Frontend (Client)

- Built with Nextjs
- Use App router for routing
- Integrates with Thirdweb for wallet connection
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn
- TypeScript for type safety

### Backend (Server)

- Written with TypeSrcipt
- Uses Api router powered by Nextjs
- MongoDB database with MySQL
- JWT-based authentication
